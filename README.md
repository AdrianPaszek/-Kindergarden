Kindergarten Simulator
The Kindergarten Simulator is designed to help kindergarten teachers efficiently manage and maintain order among children by simulating various activities and monitoring their satisfaction levels. This program allows teachers to seamlessly transition between different activities while ensuring that children remain engaged and satisfied.

Features
Activity Management
Activity Options: Teachers can choose from four activities: singing, playing ball, drawing, and dancing.
Dynamic Activity Change: Teachers can change activities hourly to keep children engaged.
Child Satisfaction: Each child responds differently to activities, affecting their satisfaction levels.
Child Behavior
Music Lover: These children have a high satisfaction level when singing and no change in satisfaction when dancing. However, their satisfaction decreases slightly during ball play and drawing.
Future Painter: These children have high satisfaction levels during drawing and minimal change during singing. However, their satisfaction decreases during dancing and ball play.
